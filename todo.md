## To do list

###Cool stuff
* problem coloring based on score?
* js confirmation alert before submission
* data dump as csv (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/outputting-csv/)
* alerts if problem sets have not been finished or attempted & due date is coming up

* index page 
  * upcoming problem sets, next 3 due?
  * recently submitted questions


### Necessary
  * install and configure celery (requires redis). also document this
  * write tests for celery (?)
  * django messaging
  * log cycling
  * deletion of automatic backups
  * django admin documentation
  * reformat views and models comments to get the right documentation for admin
  * use a modelform instead of the javascript forms to handle problemset submissions
  * include pk in file paths
  * make fixtures for basic tests
